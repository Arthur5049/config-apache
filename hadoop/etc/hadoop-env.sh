# Set Hadoop-specific environment variables here.

##
## THIS FILE ACTS AS THE MASTER FILE FOR ALL HADOOP PROJECTS.
## SETTINGS HERE WILL BE READ BY ALL HADOOP COMMANDS.  THEREFORE,
## ONE CAN USE THIS FILE TO SET YARN, HDFS, AND MAPREDUCE
## CONFIGURATION OPTIONS INSTEAD OF xxx-env.sh.
##
## Precedence rules:
##
## {yarn-env.sh|hdfs-env.sh} > hadoop-env.sh > hard-coded defaults
##
## {YARN_xyz|HDFS_xyz} > HADOOP_xyz > hard-coded defaults
##

# Many of the options here are built from the perspective that users
# may want to provide OVERWRITING values on the command line.
# For example:
#
#  JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/testing hdfs dfs -ls
#export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
# export JAVA_HOME=${JAVA_HOME}
#export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/default
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_311


# Therefore, the vast majority (BUT NOT ALL!) of these defaults
# are configured for substitution and not append.  If append
# is preferable, modify this file accordingly.

###
# Generic settings for HADOOP

# Technically, the only required environment variable is JAVA_HOME.
# All others are optional.  However, the defaults are probably not
# preferred.  Many sites configure these options outside of Hadoop,
# such as in /etc/profile.d

# The java implementation to use. By default, this environment
